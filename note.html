<div class="ql-editor" data-gramm="false" contenteditable="true"><p><br></p><h1>Day 3</h1><p><strong>About program:</strong></p><p>Today I has integreatet a Quill library in my project because a natives functions on JS to editing text is not working in React corectly. I dont wanted to do that but unfortunetly its a most fasted way to make a text editor without problem and debuging.</p><p>It was a GPT recomendation. He advised me a 3 Rich text editor librarys, one of them was from React developers <strong>BUT </strong>I chossed Quill because she have a easy customisation options, integrations whith third-party functions and main thing: work whits HTML whithout additional convertation. That is important to send notes to react native apps. If trust GPT React Native have a official library to text editing and she's support a html convertation or something like this.</p><p><br></p><p>So: Integration was not Hard and taked a 5 min. I found a way to make editor look how I want and put a fullscreen button in edit panel. that has give me some Errors, but I fixed it. After I put a more-button in punnel but she's have no functional.</p><p>Text editor work perfectly: I can make text a bold, a titled, colored, I can make a list and put a pictures in my notes(maybe this a useles function..)</p><p><br></p><p>I maked a beter list of notes. If user make just a note without a title, shortlist will show just one line of note. But if first line of note will a H1 title, shortlist will show a title with one line of note. This idea I goted today after Quill library integration. This was also take a lot of time.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Plans:</strong></p><ul><li>Remake notes saves with new TextEditor</li><li>Make panel style better(fixed)</li><li>Remake marker button</li><li>Add functional for More-button</li><li>Finish a Search System</li></ul><p>   </p><p><strong>About me:</strong></p><p>So hi. Lets try to write somethink in my notebook. Im writing my program third day without a pauses. I dont eat something yesterday because I did not buyed some product in supermarket because I dont have fucking money more of this I have a credit in bank of 16.000 UAH, that is around 350$. </p><p>Am best: Today I was eated buckweat with pate. That was perfect. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Day 4</strong></p><p>now is a 1:10, think I will eat some buckweat now and make cacao from last milk leftovers.</p><p><br></p></div>
